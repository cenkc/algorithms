/**
 * 130. Surrounded Regions
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/
 * Difficulty : Medium
 * Related Topics : Depth-first Search, Breadth-first Search, Union Find
 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 *
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * X X X X
 * X O O X
 * X X O X
 * X O X X
 *
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 *
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X O X X
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border,
 * which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
 * Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
 * Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
